# sx1231_calculator
This is a single page web app that offers an user interface to calculate the
register values for the Semtech SX1231 chip. The calculator helps in checking
the limits and dependencies of configuration option. It also tries to visualize
some settings.

It is not a substitute for the data sheet. You still need the datasheet to
lookup what options mean and how to operate the device.

All calculations are based on the publicly available datasheet. Writing this
code was tedious and error prone, and is subject to my interpretation of the
datasheet. Always check the resulting register values for correctness. I'm not
responsible for any errors, but please do file a bug report if you find a bug.

Also note that the visualizations aren't simulations. And might not be complete
nor 100% accurate. Suggestions for improvement are welcome (preferably as pull
request;) )
